    "advice": " 1. Maintain a Healthy Weight: Given your current weight, it's crucial to focus on losing excess pounds. Start by incorporating regular exercise into your routine, such as brisk walking, cycling, or swimming, for at least 30 minutes each day. Also, consider reducing portion sizes and choosing more nutrient-dense foods like fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains.\n\n2. Monitor Blood Sugar Levels: Your blood sugar reading is within the prediabetes range (100-125 mg/dL). It's essential to maintain a balanced diet with a focus on complex carbohydrates, fiber, and lean proteins. Try to limit simple sugars found in sweets, sodas, and processed foods as much as possible. Regular exercise and keeping a consistent meal schedule can also help manage blood sugar levels.\n\n3. Control Blood Pressure: Your blood pressure reading (140/90 mmHg) is higher than the recommended range (less than 120/80 mmHg). Try to reduce sodium intake by avoiding processed and fast foods, canned goods, and table salt. Increase your consumption of potassium-rich foods like bananas, oranges, and spinach, which can help lower blood pressure naturally. Regular exercise and managing stress levels are also vital for keeping blood pressure under control.\n\n4. Lower Risk Score: A risk score of 40% indicates an increased chance of developing health problems such as diabetes and heart disease. Focus on making lifestyle changes to improve your overall health, such as quitting smoking if you're a smoker, limiting alcohol consumption, getting adequate sleep (7-9 hours per night), and managing stress through activities like yoga or meditation.\n\n5. Regular Checkups: It's essential to have regular medical checkups to monitor your health and address any concerns early on. This may include blood sugar, cholesterol, and blood pressure checks, as well as discussions with your healthcare provider about personalized goals for weight loss, exercise, and diet."

Try to maintain them below 100 mg/dL if possible. This can be achieved through diet, exercise, and medication if necessary.\n\n5.
